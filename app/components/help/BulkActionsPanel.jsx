var React = require('react');

module.exports = function(props) {
  return (
  	<div>
  	  <h3>Bulk Actions Panel</h3>
  	  <p>
  	  	In the Bulk Actions panel you can automatically rename all canvases of the current sequence at the click of a button. Canvases can be 
  	  	renamed by pagination or by foliation. A drop-down menu for each button lets you select a canvas from which to start the bulk 
  	  	renaming process (default is the first canvas of the sequence). When renaming by foliation, you can choose whether to start 
  	  	with a recto or a verso page.
  	  </p>
  	</div>
  );
